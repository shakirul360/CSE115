One chilly December night in London, I was never as traumatized as I was when I witnessed a car accident. After my mathematics class, I stopped by an ice-cream shop at the vacant George Street. While paying for my scoop of ice-cream, I heard a loud screeching noise behind me. When I turned back, I noticed a kid named Rahim, a homeless orphan, trying his best to dodge an over-speeding car. The driver had hit the boy, who laid unconscious with blood gushing out of his abdomen, and drove away. I called for an emergency ambulance which arrived within a heartbeat. With the help of a nurse, we got him in the ambulance to rush to the hospital for treatment. The surgeons were waiting to receive the patient, but they could not find a pulse in Rahim’s veins. His soul had left his body to leave it cold and pale. I  went numb and mute from the shock as the police arrived to ask for the car’s descriptions that night.
